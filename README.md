# Rust Game

Roguelike game built with rustbox, a rust binding for the termbox C library.

This project is meant as a pratical way for me to learn Rust and is not playable yet.

## Usage

Make sure you have `rustc` and `cargo` installed, then run `cargo run` in a terminal to start the game.

Press `q` to quit.
